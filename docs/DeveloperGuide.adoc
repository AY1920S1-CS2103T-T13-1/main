== Introduction
Welcome to ORGANice! This is an organ matching desktop application that is specifically designed for fast typing
hospital administration staff. This developer guide is meant for developers who would like to understand the
design and structure of ORGANice.

== Setting up

To set up the developer tools needed to develop ORGANice, refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section provides a high-level overview of ORGANice's codebase.
It is divided into 6 subsections:

* Architecture
* UI component
* Logic component
* Model component
* Storage component
* Common classes

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
The Architecture section is meant to explain the high-level design of ORGANice.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above depicts the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The `main` folder contains two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for performing the following tasks:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

This section explains the interactions amongst the different architecture components using an example.
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section explains the design of the UI component. +
Figure 4 below depicts the classes in the UI component and their relationships with one another.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section explains the design of the Logic component. +
Figure 5 below depicts the classes in the Logic component and their relationships with one  another.
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `organice.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Matching feature
This section describes how the matching feature is implemented.

Matching is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`, then creating
`MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects to store the match results. The `MatchedPatient` and `MatchedDonor` objects
are stored in a separate `listOfMatches` list.

To facilitate the matching, the following methods were added to `ModelManager`:

* `ModelManager#matchDonors(Patient patient)` -- Matches all donors in ORGANice with the specified Patient.
For each Donor that matches the patient, a `MatchedDonor` objected is created and stored.
* `ModelManager#matchPatients()` -- Matches all donors with all patients.

After matching the patients and donors, the `MainWindow` decides which list to display via the `CommandResult#isMatch`
method.

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Bugs introduced
This section explains why the current implementation is chosen.
Previously, the matching feature was implemented by storing match results in the
`Patient` and `Donor` objects.

Each `Patient` and `Donor` has a `isMatch()` method, which checks if the match results should be displayed
or if the `Patient` and `Donor` attributes should be displayed. The match results will be displayed when `isMatch()`
evaluates to `true`.

It was discovered that there were many bugs introduced via this approach. The root cause of the bugs could not be
identified.

// tag::formmode[]
=== Add person `Form` mode feature
==== Implementation

The `Form` mode mechanism is facilitated by `FormUiManager`.
It modifies the `CommandBox` as well as `PersonPanelListPlaceholder` each time a user input a specific attribute.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FormUiManager#getPersonField()` -- Modifies `CommandBox` and prompts the user to input a specific attribute.
* `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` -- Sets the value for all required attributes of a specific type of person.
* `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()` -- Adds a doctor to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()` -- Adds a patient to the person list.
* `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` -- Adds a donor to the person list.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface when the specific command is invoked by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Form` mode mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add t/doctor` command to add a doctor in a `Form` mode. The `add` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` that will return a new `AddCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` executes the command and notice that the `Command` is a `Form` type command and thus will create a new `FormUiManager` instance.

Step 4. The `FormUiManager` changes the display of the application based on the type of the person specified in Step 1 by modifying the content of the `PersonListPanelPlaceholder` as well as the `CommandExecutor` in the `CommandBox` object by calling `FormUiManager#getPersonFields()`.

Step 5. The user inputs the attribute that is prompted until all the required attributes are specified.

Step 6. The user confirms the details of the person and `FormUiManager#setPersonDetails()` will be called and depending on the type of the person specified, calling `FormUiManager#addDoctorToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addPatientToList()`, or `FormUiManager#addDonorToList()` respectively.

Step 7. `FormUiManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to add the person and save it in the `Storage` interface.

==== Design Considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same `add` command to do the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May not be the best approach since one command will have two different modes.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new command for the `Form` mode.
** Pros: Will be less confusing for the user since there is a separate command for `Form` mode
** Cons: We must creates a new parser and command classes just to deal with another `add` functionality.

// end::formmode[]

// tag::dataencryption[]

=== Sort feature
This section describes how the sort feature is implemented.

Sorting is done by using `Comparators` in the `Logic` component.

To facilitate the sorting, the following methods were added:

{More to be added}

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for the interactions with the `Logic` component for the `execute(sort/rate)`

.Structure of the Logic Component when executing `sort` command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect:

=== Processing feature
This section describes how the processing feature is implemented.

Processing is done by accessing `Patient` and `Donor` in `ModelManager`, then creating an ArrayList named, `ProcessingList` to store the tasks needed to do.

If the donor and patient pair had never been processed before, a default `ProcessingList` will be generated and it will belong to the patient and donor pair uniquely.

If the user made any changes to the `ProcessingList`, the list will be saved to the donor as one of its attribute which takes in a parameter of the patient's NRIC.

//Todo: additional feature such as add tasks, delete tasks etc

==== Design considerations
This section will explain the reason for having some aspects.

===== Aspect: Method of storing the `ProcessingList`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use ArrayList to store the tasks.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: It is not the most efficient algorithm and the huge number of `ProcessingList` may take up a huge datafile at the end of the day.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a new class that works like ArrayList.
** Pros: Able to implement more specific methods for the ProcessingList.
** Cons: More methods and test cases needed and it is harder to implement.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
