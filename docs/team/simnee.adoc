== PROJECT: ORGANice

:sectnums:
== Introduction
This document aims to show an overview of my involvements in the project, ORGANice.
My role in this project was to implement the task list for the users to track the
administrative tasks that needs to be done.

=== Project Description
ORGANice is developed by a team of five students in National University of Singapore (NUS).
All of us are year 2 Computer Science students,taking the Software Engineering module, CS2103T.

=== Project Scope
ORGANice was made for our CS2103T module's team project (TP). Over the course of 6 weeks, we were tasked
with either enhancing or morphing a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop addressbook application.
We chose to morph it into an organ transplant manager, ORGANice.

The target audiences of ORGANice are the hospital administrative staffs as we aim to help ease their
workload when trying to match all their patients with all the donors' organs they have.

=== Project Summary
ORGANice is an organ transplant manager.
Currently, hospital administrative staffs have many patients and organ donors information in their records.
Whenever, they have a new patient who needed an organ, they often have to go through many manual search and
matching to find a compatible donor. We aim to reduce such menial work using ORGANice and speed up this process.

ORGANice is able to:

* `add` and `edit` patients, donors and doctors information.

* `list` the entire database information.

* `match` the patients and show potential compatible donor's information.

* `sort` the result after using `match` command.

* `find` a specific patient, donor or doctor in ORGANice.

* `processing` a patient and a donor who are compatible to generate a
list of administrative tasks to do for the patient and donor.

* `done` processing a patient and donor pair and determine if they can be removed from the matching pool.

This is what ORGANice looks like:

== Summary of Contributions
This section lists the codes and documentations I contributed to ORGANice.

I was responsible of implementing the `processing`, `processingMarkDone` and `done` commands.
I also ensured the code quality is up to standard.

=== Main Feature : `Processing`
This section will explain the command, `processing` I implemented for ORGANice.

*** What it does:
It allow user to view a whole list of administrative tasks which needs to be done to arrange for cross-matching test
between a patient and a donor.

*** Justification:
Hospital staffs often need to do a lot of paper work and administrative tasks.
There is now an increasing number of patients admitting to hospitals and if they need an organ,
there will be a standard operating procedure which need to be followed.
With ORGANice, staffs will not need to manually keep track of which tasks are not yet done for every patients.

*** Highlights:
A default task list will be generated when the user use the command with valid NRICs of donor and patient.
The task list generated belong to the donor and patient only.
This will not lead to any confusions as
it is impossible to have a donor matching with more than one patient or a patient matching with more than one donor.

=== Main Feature : `ProcessingMarkDone`
This section will explain the command, `processingMarkDone` I implemented for ORGANice.

*** What it does:
It allows users to mark a task on
