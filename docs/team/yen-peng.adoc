== Project Portfolio for ORGANice
---
The purpose of this project portfolio is to present my main contributions towards a team project called ORGANice.

== 1. Introduction

This section covers the project scope and description, followed an explanation of formats used in this portfolio.

=== 1.1 Project Scope

ORGANice is the product of a software engineering project done by a team of 5 students, including myself, who are second-year Computer Science students from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Under a two-month-long time frame, we conceptualised ORGANice and moulded it from an existing application, known as "Address Book", that stores and manages people's contact information.
For the languages used, ORGANice is written in Java while its Graphical User Interface (GUI) is written in JavaFX.

=== 1.1 About ORGANice

ORGANice is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application, meaning that user interaction is mainly through typing in commands.

This application is targeted at hospital administrators and its main features include storing hospital information,
finding compatible donors for patients awaiting organ transplants, and following up on administrative matters related to the organ matching process.

**ORGANice is able to do the following for you:**

* Store and maintain doctors, donors, and patients information using `add` and `edit`
* Find information quickly using `find` and `list`
* Find compatible organ donors for patients using `match`
* Sort matches according to different criteria using `sort`
* Keep track of patient-donor pairs slated for further compatibility tests using `processing`
* Keep track of subsequent administrative tasks to do by marking completed tasks as done using `processingmarkdone`
* Determine if organ transplant is a success and mark pair as `done` to remove from future matching results

**This is what ORGANice looks like:**

=== 1.2 Meaning of the Formats Used

The following is a list of various formats used and what they mean:

* `sort`  --  Grey highlighted texts in the excerpts of sections 3 and 4 are technical terms used in this project.
* https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/153[#153]  --  Blue underlined texts consist of a link that brings you to relevant information on the webpage.

== 2. Summary of Contributions

This section elaborates on the enhancements I did to ORGANice with the relevant links (in blue) appended.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to sort matches according to different criteria. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/145[#145])
** What it does: Allows the user to sort patient-donor pairs according to compatibility rate, priority of the patient, or donor's organ expiry date.
** Justification: Helps the hospital to make more informed decisions after knowing which pairs are the most compatible, which patient to prioritize, and which organs are expiring soon respectively.
** Highlights: Able to in more sorting options in future enhancements. The implementation is challenging as it required an in-depth analysis of how the match feature is implemented.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a list feature that allows the user to list down all persons or persons of a specified type in ORGANice. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/113[#113])

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an organ class to ORGANice. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/86[#86])

* *Minor enhancement*: Designed the logo of ORGANice, and updated the application window to display title and logo. (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T13-1/main/pull/136[#136])

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

This section showcases my ability to write documentation targeting end-users through an excerpt of what I wrote for the User Guide.

{Start of excerpt from User Guide}

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=edit]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=list]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=help]

{End of excerpt from User Guide}

== 4. Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section showcases my ability to write technical documentation and to visually represent a system using
Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams in the Developer Guide.

The following is a Model Diagram that I have updated in order to reflect the changes made to the application:

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=modeldiagram]



In addition, I have also written the implementation and use cases for the 'List' and 'Sort' features as shown in the excerpt below.
