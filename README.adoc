== Introduction

ORGANice is an organ transplant manager. +
This desktop application aims to facilitate the matching of organ transplants between patients and organ donors in hospitals. +
It is written in Java language in an Object-oriented fashion.

== Motivation

It is undeniable that organ transplantation is one of the most life-changing medical breakthroughs in history. +
